# Simple restful example
Simple restful service example using spring framework

## Objective

The aim of this project is providing an example of a basic restful API using spring framework. This can serve as a reference or skeleton to create more sophisticated services.

This project intentionally exclude any extra unrequired functionality in order to keep the project as simple as possible. For example, no database nor storage is implemented, all data is stored in memory and is lost when the process gets closed.
